INTRODUCTION						       *ferrum*

Interact with REPL within working buffer.

ferrum is named after `iron.nvim`. Like how iron stands for "Interactive REPL
Over Neovim," ferrum goes by "Flexible Embedded REPL Runner for Unnecessary
Multiprocessing."

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION					 *ferrum-configuration*

Install using your favourite package manager, then
>lua
    require('ferrum').setup {...}
<

Move your cursor onto the filepath below and type |gf| to view all available
options and the defaults:
>
    ../lua/ferrum/config.lua
<
If that doesn't work, |gx| on this one:

==============================================================================
USAGE							 *ferrum-usage*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Commands					      *ferrum-commands*

							 *ferrum-:REPL*
:[N]REPL {command}	Start a REPL session for buffer [N] in a new, focused
			window. If [N] is not given, use the current buffer.

			Upon a successful invocation, `:REPL` creates sereval
			|ferrum-buflocal-commands| on the invoking buffer
			which communicates with and controls the spawned
			session (documented below). These commands will be
			deleted when the REPL session finishes.

			A REPL session could be controlled by multiple
			buffers, but one REPL session per buffer only. Running
			`:REPL` on a bound buffer unlinks current bound
			session before a new one comes in.

:[N]REPL! {command}	Start a REPL session for buffer [N] in a new,
			unfocused window. if [N] is not given, use the current
			buffer.

							     *b:ferrum*
:[N]REPL[!]		With no arguments, `:REPL` the command given by
			`b:ferrum`. If not set, prompt for a shell command.

			`b:ferrum` may be either a string or a list of strings.
			Special keywords like `%` `%:h` will be expanded.

						     *ferrum-:LinkREPL*
:LinkREPL [job]		Connect current buffer to a running REPL session given
			job id (tab-completion available), which may be
			omitted when there is one and only one active REPL
			session spawned by ferrum.

			A buffer can only be linked to one session at a time;
			linking to a new session automatically unlinks the
			previous one.

			|ferrum-buflocal-commands| will be defined. Or
			redefined.

`:REPL` is just a shortcut to spawn a session then `:LinkREPL` to its job id.
Manually spawning a session (e.g. with |:term| or |:Start|) and link to it has
the exact same effect.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Buffer-local commands			     *ferrum-buflocal-commands*

These commands will be set up by `:REPL` after successfully spawning a
session. They are no longer available once the session finishes.

						     *ferrum-:SendREPL*
:SendREPL {text}	Send arbitrary text to the REPL session bound to the
			current buffer. Does not return at the end; users may
			find |:SendlnREPL| more useful.

						   *ferrum-:SendlnREPL*
:SendlnREPL {text}	Like |:SendREPL|, but includes a newline at the end.

						*ferrum-:SendRangeREPL*
:[range]SendRangeREPL	|:SendlnREPL| each line in [range] lines to the bound
			REPL session.

						    *ferrum-:FocusREPL*
:FocusREPL[!]		Focus on the bound REPL session. Useful when the user
			accidentally closes REPL window.
			- If the REPL session buffer has been opened in a
			  window, focus on it;
			- If multiple windows have been opened for the REPL
			  session buffer, focus on a random one;
			- If the REPL session buffer is not being displayed in
			  any window, open a new split and focus on it.

			With [!] also |:startinsert|.

						     *ferrum-:StopREPL*
:StopREPL[!]		End the bound REPL session, and delete the
			buffer-local commands created by `:REPL` (including
			self) on all client buffers of this session. With [!]
			also delete the terminal buffer and close the window,
			if not already.

						   *ferrum-:UnlinkREPL*
:UnlinkREPL		Detaches the bound REPL session from current buffer,
			reverse of |ferrum-:LinkREPL|. Delete the buffer-local
			commands created by `:REPL` (including self).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User autocmds					 *ferrum-user-autocmds*

ferrum offers several autocmds:
>
    ../lua/ferrum/autocmds/user.lua
<

				       *FerrumBuflocalCommandsSetupPre*
				      *FerrumBuflocalCommandsSetupPost*
FerrumBuflocalCommandsSetupPre
FerrumBuflocalCommandsSetupPost
			Before and after ferrum setting up buflocal commands
			on a buffer.

			A table with these keys will be passed as
			|event-data|:
			• client: (integer) client buffer id
			• repl: (integer) REPL buffer id
			• job: (integer) job id
			• cmd: (string[]) shell command executed

				     *FerrumBuflocalCommandsCleanupPre*
				    *FerrumBuflocalCommandsCleanupPost*
FerrumBuflocalCommandsCleanupPre  
FerrumBuflocalCommandsCleanupPost
			Before and after buflocal commands set up by ferrum
			gets removed.

			A table with these keys will be passed as
			|event-data|:
			• buf: (integer) target buffer id

						    *FerrumLinkREPLPre*
						   *FerrumLinkREPLPost*
FerrumLinkREPLPre
FerrumLinkREPLPost
			Before and after ferrum links a client buffer to a
			session.

			A table with these keys will be passed as
			|event-data|:
			• client: (integer) client buffer id
			• repl: (integer) REPL buffer id
			• job: (integer) job id
			• cmd: (string[]) shell command executed

						  *FerrumSpawnREPLPost*
FerrumSpawnREPLPost	After ferrum successfully spawns a REPL session.

			A table with these keys will be passed as
			|event-data|:
			• client: (integer) client buffer id
			• repl: (integer) REPL buffer id
			• job: (integer) job id
			• cmd: (string[]) shell command executed

						 *FerrumFinishREPLPost*
FerrumFinishREPLPost	After finishing a REPL session, one that was previous
			linked to a client.

			A table with these keys will be passed as
			|event-data|:
			• client: (integer) client buffer id, which this
			  session has been linked to
			• repl: (integer) REPL buffer id
			• job: (integer) job id
			• cmd: (string[]) shell command executed
